Every meaningful contribution is welcome.
You may fix a typo or add content to files, you can add new files to existing folders or even add new folders. You may add a new algorithmic implementation or improver an earlier one, or add a new learning resource, or simply add anything you find worth adding.

You can raise an issue, if you need to, or directly submit a PR addressing some issue. [This issue](https://github.com/pr4shan7/Hacktoberfest/issues/1) is a great first issue to address and get started.

Please describe your PRs otherwise they might not be reviewed.
Also, describing your code through comments or adding a `README.md` for describing your content, should be done as it helps everyone viewing those files.

Please use proper directory structure, that is, place your new files in proper folders (create those folders if they don't exist). It is advised to use `lisp-case` for naming files.

Have fun learning!
